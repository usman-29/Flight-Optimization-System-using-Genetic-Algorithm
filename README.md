Flight Optimization with Genetic Algorithm

Welcome to the Flight Optimization project! üöÄ‚úàÔ∏è

This repository houses an innovative flight optimization system that leverages genetic algorithms to find the top three optimal routes for air travel. Whether you're a frequent flyer, a travel enthusiast, or an aviation professional, this project aims to enhance your journey planning experience.

### Key Features:
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization:** Employing genetic algorithms to efficiently search for the best flight routes based on various parameters such as weather, duration, and aircraft.
- **Interactive Interface:** A user-friendly interface that allows users to input their preferences and receive personalized recommendations for their travel plans.
- **Top Three Recommendations:** Presenting users with the top three optimized routes, providing flexibility and choice in their travel decisions.

### How to Use:
1. **Clone the Repository:** Get started by cloning this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Check the documentation for details.
3. **Run the Application:** Execute the main script to launch the flight optimization system.
4. **Input Preferences:** Enter your travel preferences, such as departure city, destination.
5. **Receive Recommendations:** Explore the top three recommended flight routes based on the genetic algorithm optimization.

### Contributions:
Contributions are welcome! Whether you want to enhance the genetic algorithm, improve the user interface, or add support for additional features, feel free to submit pull requests. Please check the contribution guidelines for more details.

We also encourage contributors interested in geospatial enhancements to consider adding Google Maps integration to enrich the user experience. Integrating Google Maps can provide visual insights into flight routes and enhance the overall functionality of the application. If you have ideas or contributions related to this feature, we'd love to see your creativity take flight! üó∫Ô∏è‚ú®
